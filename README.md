### 🧠 What I Do

I’m a **sound designer and developer** who blends code and creativity to build immersive audio experiences, tools, and productions.  
I love experimenting at the intersection of **music technology**, **cybersecurity**, and **software development** — creating projects that merge sound and system-level logic in unexpected ways.
