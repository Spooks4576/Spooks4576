# 👻 Spooky / Spooks4576

**Sound designer + coder** messing around with audio tools, game dev, and breaking things (legally).  
23, he/him.

I build stuff where sound meets low-level systems—think game audio engines, interactive tools, and cybersecurity experiments. Mostly C++ and Python, occasional JavaScript when forced.

**Current fixations:** interactive audio tools, music production workflows, reverse engineering weird stuff

My personal site—random utilities, experiments, and portfolio stuff. HTML/CSS/JS backend, nothing fancy but it works.

Lead dev for the studio. Built the site, backend APIs, all that. JavaScript/Node stack.
